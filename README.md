# Tron
using embedded C, making the game TRON on a VGA display and controlled with a De10-lite.

The TRON.c code can be simulated on CPUlator, replace the #include address_map_niosv with the entire contents of that file. There are instructions in that file of what to do if you're using a DE10-lite or CPUlator/DEsoc.
